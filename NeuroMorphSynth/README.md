NeuroMorphSynth is an innovative software framework designed for creative audio signal morphing using dynamic envelope modulation. Built in Python, it enables users to blend two audio waveforms into a smooth, evolving hybrid sound by applying sinusoidal crossfading based on amplitude envelopes.

The system leverages libraries like librosa, numpy, and scipy to extract features from the audio inputs, perform time-based signal processing, and synthesize a new, transformed audio output. It is particularly useful for sound designers, musicians, audio researchers, and AI enthusiasts working on generative or experimental audio.

The project includes waveform visualization, playback support, and parameter customization, making it a compact and interactive audio synthesis tool. With its modular structure and artistic potential, NeuroMorphSynth qualifies as a copyrightable software asset under the literary/software category.
