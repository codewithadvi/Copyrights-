#  Neural Audio Morphing Lab

**Real-time interactive blending of two audio sources with reverb, visuals, and creative control.**

---

##  Overview

A creative audio lab that lets you explore the morphing of two distinct sounds in real time. Built for interactive experimentation, it allows users to control the morph level, choose from various blending styles, and visualize the transformation through waveforms and spectrograms.

Whether you're a sound artist, an educator, or just curious about audio transformation, this project brings an intuitive, hands-on approach to audio fusion.
