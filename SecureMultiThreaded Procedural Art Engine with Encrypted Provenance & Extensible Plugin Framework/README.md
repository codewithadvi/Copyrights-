# SecureMultiThreaded Procedural Art Engine with Encrypted Provenance & Extensible Plugin Framework

## Overview

This Java-based project is an advanced procedural art generator that combines multi-threading, a flexible plugin system, and encrypted provenance tracking to create unique and verifiable digital art outputs. Designed with modularity and security in mind, it supports multiple procedural algorithms and ensures the integrity and authorship of generated content through cryptographic hashing and AES encryption.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Threaded Execution**: Efficiently utilizes concurrency to generate complex patterns, improving performance on multi-core systems.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easily extensible design allowing addition of new procedural art algorithms without modifying the core engine.
- **Encrypted Provenance**: Embeds metadata and cryptographic hashes within encrypted payloads to guarantee authenticity and track generation details securely.
- **Configurable via Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**: User-friendly configuration interface enables customization of pattern type, size, threading, encryption keys, and licensing.
- **Multiple Procedural Algorithms**: Includes fractal trees, cellular automata, and L-system patterns as demonstration plugins.
- **Robust Cryptography**: Uses SHA-256 for hashing and AES for encryption, adhering to modern security standards.

## Novelty

Unlike typical procedural art generators, this engine integrates cryptographic techniques to secure the provenance of generated artwork. The plugin-based design promotes scalability and maintainability, encouraging further algorithmic innovation. Multi-threading enhances computational efficiency, allowing creation of more complex and larger-scale patterns in feasible time. The comprehensive metadata embedding and encryption elevate this project from a simple pattern generator to a verifiable, copyright-ready digital asset creator.

## Usage

The program reads configuration settings from a simple DSL string, dynamically loads the specified pattern plugin, generates the art concurrently, and outputs:

- The ASCII art pattern
- Associated metadata including license and versioning
- SHA-256 hash of the combined output
- Encrypted provenance data encoded in Base64

To run, compile and execute the `Main` class with Java 8 or later.

## Potential Extensions

- Addition of GUI for interactive pattern selection and configuration.
- Integration with blockchain for decentralized provenance verification.
- Support for exporting generated art to graphical formats (SVG, PNG).
- More complex pattern plugins leveraging advanced mathematics and fractal theory.
